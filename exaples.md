Making arrangements

Think about these points when the purpose of your email is to make an arrangement.

Useful questions

Here are some typical questions used for making arrangements:

Are you free next Tuesday afternoon?
What time would you like to meet?
When would be convenient for you?
Could you please let me know?
Expressions of time

Use on with days: Could we meet on Monday?

Use in with months, years and other expressions: I'm going to visit my grandparents in October.

Use at with times and other expressions: Could you please call me at 3pm?

Use next to refer to future times: I hope we can meet again next week.

Use when to start a future time clause: Let's meet again when it is convenient.

Tenses

To speak about a timetable, use the present simple: Next term runs from 1 September until 16 December.

To speak about a future arrangement, use the present continuous: Mr Toshiko is coming to our next meeting.

To speak about a plan, use 'be going to': Next term we are going to learn about pollution.

See the talking about the future page for more practice.

Tenses in complex sentences about the future

Use the present simple after when, if and next time in future time clauses:

I will call you when I get to the station.
I'm going to work with my dad when I finish school.
Let's go for a walk if the weather is good.
Will you visit the Eiffel Tower next time you are in Paris?


Enquiries

Consider these things when writing questions.

Subject questions

These questions are about the subject of a sentence:

Who takes you to school?
Where is your favourite place?
What annoys you the most?
When is convenient?
Do not add auxiliary verbs ('do', 'does', 'did', etc.): Who takes you ...? not Who does take you ...?

Yes/no questions

These questions usually only need a short answer like 'yes'/'yes, of course' or 'no'/ 'no, I'm sorry'.

Are you ready?
Is that convenient?
Do you remember me?
Can you send me the report, please?
Use the auxiliary verb before the subject: Do you remember ...? not You do remember ...?

Object questions

These questions are about the object of a sentence:

Where do you want to meet?
Who did you invite to the meeting?
Why couldn't you go?
How much is this going to cost?
Remember to use an auxiliary verb ('do', 'did', 'have', 'can', etc.): Where do you want to meet? not Where you want to meet?

'Let me know'

When you ask about something in an email, you can use this phrase. It shows that you want to get an answer.

Are you coming to the party on Saturday? Could you let me know? Thanks…
I would like to attend the training next Tuesday. Please can you let me know the start time?


Organising your writing

The people you write to will understand well-organised emails much more easily.

Writer purpose

When you write an email, you need to make clear why you are writing. You can do this by using the phrase 'I am writing to (+ verb)' at the start of your email. Here are some examples:

I am writing to	ask for further details about ...
inform you that my new address is …
complain about your customer service. 
say thank you very much for all your hard work. 
apply for the job as Teacher of Maths at your school.
 

 

 

h2. Paragraphs

Emails are easier to read if the writer uses paragraphs.
A paragraph in an email is often two or three sentences long.
Each paragraph starts on a new line.
When you start writing about a new topic, you can start a new paragraph.
Look at this example email to a friend.

Paragraph 1

Greeting	Hello Dmitri, 
How is life? I haven't seen you for a long time. How are your children?

Paragraph 2
Reason for writing	I'm writing with some good news – my wife is having a baby next month. We think it's going to be a girl, and we're very excited. But I also wanted to ask you something!

Paragraph 3
Request	You told me you have lots of baby clothes. Do you think I could borrow some for my baby? I've looked in the shops, and new baby clothes are so expensive … Could you let me know if this is OK?

Paragraph 4
Other news	By the way, I've also started a new job. It's going really well!

Paragraph 5
'look forward to' and ending	Anyway, I look forward to hearing from you soon. Give my best wishes to your wife and family. Regards, 
George
